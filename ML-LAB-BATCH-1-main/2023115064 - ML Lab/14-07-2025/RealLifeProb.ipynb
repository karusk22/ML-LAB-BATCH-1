The goal is to analyze the sensor data to detect anomalies, understand machine behavior, and help the engineering team optimize the system.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### Dataset\n","\n","* You receive raw sensor readings as a **1D list** of 10,000 integer values representing temperature measurements (in °C \\* 100, e.g., 2535 means 25.35°C) sampled every second from multiple sensors concatenated.\n","* These sensors are arranged in 20 machines, each with 500 readings.\n","* Some readings may be noisy or have outliers.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### Tasks\n","\n","#### 1. **Data Preparation and Cleaning**\n","\n","* Convert the raw list into a NumPy array.\n","* Reshape the 1D data into a 20×500 2D matrix, where each row corresponds to one machine’s sensor readings.\n","* For each machine, use `floor()`, `ceil()`, and `isqrt()` on the first 10 readings and interpret the results.\n","* Detect and remove outliers from each machine's data using statistical thresholds (e.g., values beyond mean ± 3 std dev).\n","\n","#### 2. **Statistical Analysis**\n","\n","* Calculate the mean, median, and variance of temperature readings for each machine.\n","* Find the machine with the highest average temperature and the one with the lowest.\n","* Calculate the sine of the normalized readings (normalized to \\[0, π]) for any pattern detection.\n","\n","#### 3. **Linear Algebra and Matrix Operations**\n","\n","* Compute the covariance matrix (20×20) representing correlation between machine sensors.\n","* Find eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the covariance matrix using SciPy.\n","* Identify the principal components (top 2 eigenvectors) that explain most variance in sensor readings.\n","\n","#### 4. **Matrix Subsetting and Determinants**\n","\n","* Extract a 5×5 submatrix from the covariance matrix representing a group of 5 related machines.\n","* Calculate row-wise and column-wise sums of this submatrix.\n","* Calculate its determinant and eigenvalues to check if these machines are strongly correlated.\n","\n","#### 5. **Optimization and Insights**\n","\n","* Use gcd and integer square root methods to analyze patterns in periodic sensor readings (e.g., gcd of time intervals between spikes).\n","* Summarize all findings and suggest which machines require maintenance or closer monitoring based on statistical and linear algebra insights.\n","\n","---\n"],"metadata":{"id":"CSYYbCUTNZl-"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import numpy as np\n","import pandas as pd\n","from scipy import linalg\n","from math import floor, ceil, isqrt, gcd, sin, pi\n","\n","np.random.seed(42)\n","data = np.random.normal(loc=2500, scale=100, size=10000).astype(int)\n","df = pd.DataFrame(data)\n","df.to_csv('sensor_data.csv', index=False, header=False)\n","\n","df = pd.read_csv('sensor_data.csv', header=None)\n","sensor_array = df[0].to_numpy()\n","sensor_matrix = sensor_array.reshape((20, 500))\n","\n","floor_vals = np.floor(sensor_matrix[:, :10]).astype(int)\n","ceil_vals = np.ceil(sensor_matrix[:, :10]).astype(int)\n","isqrt_vals = np.array([[isqrt(abs(x)) for x in row] for row in sensor_matrix[:, :10]])\n","\n","cleaned_matrix = np.copy(sensor_matrix).astype(float)\n","for i in range(20):\n","    m = np.mean(cleaned_matrix[i])\n","    s = np.std(cleaned_matrix[i])\n","    mask = (cleaned_matrix[i] < m -
